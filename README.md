# Selenium

I am trying out multiple examples of Selenium to better understand the features and functionalities offered.

#WebDriverDemo 
This is an example project. 

1. It uses FirefoxDriver and FirefoxDriverService classes to spin off an instance of firefox and launch google.com.
2. Interacts with the page by finding elements.
  a. ClassName might return multiple elements, index to get to the right element.
  b.  CssSelector
  c. Id - most preferred, cause it gives a single name
  d. LinkText
  e. PartialLinkText 
  f. Name
  g. TagName
  h. XPath - Last option
c
All these require excessive knowledge of the UI development and not the requirements.
